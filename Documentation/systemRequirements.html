				<h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe already have some functional templates and they are ready to be tested. As the client faces many disabilities created by the Stroke pathology, the tasks must be easy to use, with non-distractful functionalities and user-friendly.
				<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt this moment, we created two sides of templates. The first one is the patient side, where is a working demo that can be released to the neuropsychologists and to be tested with the patients. There we can receive some reviews and feedback, and some possible corrections about them. The other side is the doctor side, where the doctors can create their own templates using a base template. It is implemented a simple template (user-friendly and ease to use) that doctors can create templates to the various among patients in the clinic. Due to the different disabilities that patients have, doctors must create different tasks with different levels to help their recovers and make their improvements much better.
				<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere we can show the functional templates that are ready to be delivered to the neuropsychologists and be tested:

					<div class="container">
						<h3>Nominate Task</h3>
						<h5>
						<p>In this task, the patient sees a photo of someone that is his relative or friend and tries to discover his name by some hidden words. When he clicks on the black box that misses one letter, he (or the doctor if he can’t do it by himself) clicks again on the letter that is associated to that hidden letter. If he wrongs, appears a message that tries to motivate him and not let him giving up. If he hits, appears a feedback message that encourage to conclude it and saying that he is doing great.</p>

				<section class="sequenceTask text-left" id="sequenceTask">

						<h3>Sequence Task</h3>
						<h5>
						<p>In this task, the patient have multiple images to be drag and dropped into some boxes down below the images. If he can’t do it by himself, the doctor must do it for him by his choice of answer. If he drag and drop one image to the wrong box he gets a message saying to try again. If he gets all the correct boxes, he receives a feedback message saying that he has successfully done the task. The images can be numbers, daily sequence tasks or anything that the doctors think that are good to get the patients’ recover.</p>

						<p>In this task, the patient have one question and a possible of 2, 3 or 4 answers and have to guess what is the correct one. The questions may be whatever the doctors choose for the respective doctors. May be daily questions or questions about their families or their personal life. If the patient hits he receives a feedback message that says the answer is correct. If he gets the wrong answer the patient has more tries to guess and he receives a message to not give up.</p>
