				<h3>Background</h3>
				<h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor our bachelor subject, Informatics Engineering Project, we were given a pool of
					project themes to choose from and work on. Given the options, our team opted to go for a
					project that could have an impact on the daily life of someone in need and hopefully be
					helpful. We named our project, Stroke Rehab. As the name self-explains, Stroke Rehab
					focus on the cognitive rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, helping them overcome all
					mental disabilities created by the pathology.
					<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Stroke Rehab will be presented to the public through a web platform. In the
					platform, the user (doctors) will have informations about the patients, such as personal data
					and health statistics. They will also have tasks to be configured to the patients.</h5>

																				<!-- Business Opportunity -->

				<h3>Business Opportunity</h3>
				<h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith Stroke Rehab we have a platform that provides cognitive exercises with
					relatable content for each patient (favourite hobbies/activities, family pictures, etc). This
					comes to fill a gap that none of the existing platforms do, since they provide standardized
					tasks/exercises templates that don’t capture the patient’s attention and fail to motivate.
					<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStroke Rehab’s main goal is to help post-stroke patients and overcome all their mental
					disabilities created by it and stand out in the market by bringing an unique platform with
					diverse templates configured for each patient. It is important to underline that in Stroke
					Rehab, each patient will have statistics of their tasks results and health variations in order to
					get the neuropsychologists’ evaluations.
					<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith a simple and user-friendly design, it is possible, in an efficient way, to consult
					each patient’s statistics and to do tasks for each patient, provided by neuropsychologists.</h5>
