				<h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur platform “Stroke Rehab” has two actors: doctors and patients. It has authentication for both of them and the main objective of this platform is to have various templates/tasks for the patients so they can evolve their mental disabilities.
<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe templates must be different due to the differentiated stroke levels of the patients and the doctors can decide what templates and how many templates must a patient perform. Those templates are made by the doctors (configured by them) in order to create tasks for each patient and create a “patient story”. For example, in “Multiple Choice Template”, the doctor can configure a question about something that is related to the patient’s life or even in “Nominate Template”, the doctor can configure an image of a patient’s relative. This configuration side is very important because it has much more impact on the client and the patient’s recovery would be easier and faster. Also, it is easier for the doctors to connect with the platform and patients, creating various templates.
<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOther objective is that the doctors can save the templates and set them for the patients they want to perform it. They can edit them later and schedule for a date one or more templates for the patients. One advantage is that the templates have feedback phrases, in order to don’t let the patient give up or, if the patient succeeded in the task, to congratulate him. The doctors can create or edit those feedback phrases in a more appropriate way of each patient.
<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnother main goal of the platform is that have statistic charts of the task’s results. According to the results, each patient have a page on his account that have his results and the doctors can see their improvements and then, keep or change his tasks program.
<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe templates that the platform has are: “Nominate Task”, “Sequence Task”, “Multiple Choice Task”, “Categorization Task” and “Visual Recognition Memory Task”. In “Nominate Task”, the patient sees a photo of someone that is his relative or friend and tries to discover his name by some hidden words. In “Sequence Task”, the patient have multiple images to be drag and dropped into some boxes down below the images. In “Multiple Choice Task”, the patient have one question and a possible of 2 or more answers and have to guess what is the correct one. In “Categorization Task”, the patient have multiple images to be drag and dropped into some boxes down below the images. In “Visual Recognition Memory Task”, the patient have multiple images and he has to select the ones that are related to the category shown below the images.
<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDue to the fact some patients have more disabilities than others, if a patient can’t do one task by himself he can do it with the help of the doctor. If the patient can’t point with one finger to the computer screen, maybe he can speak and do the task in the same. There are many disabilities in Stroke Rehab and they can be voided replacing with other features. That’s why we added the voice recognition functionality. We added it in templates so that the patient can speak and try to do the task anyway. For example, in “Nominate Task” the patient can try to guess the name of the person that is in the photo and say it. If the name is wrong, it appears a wrong feedback message, if it is correct, appears a correct feedback message.

				<h5>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur platform will have two actors: doctors and patients. Both of them will have authentication and different types of accounts.
<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe patient’s account will have their info data, their pre-defined/scheduled templates and their results of the tasks in charts. It will be available in different pages and this can be all accessible by the doctors. The patients can also choose what templates they want to do or to do firstly, or else the doctors can choose them randomly.
<p></p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe doctor’s account will have one page for the templates/tasks configuration, to save, edit and delete them, they can define and schedule the templates for each patient and see the statistics of the results of the tasks done by the patients. They can also add, edit and remove patients to the database, simultaneously giving each of them an username and a password to sign in later in order to complete the tasks previously configured.
